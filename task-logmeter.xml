  <title>Receiving a Customer Meter</title>
  <shortdesc>This entry describes how to log in a customer's M800 meter for
    recalibration.</shortdesc>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>Each customer’s meter has been assigned a “Return Material Authorization” (RMA) 
        number which is written on a tag attached to both the M00 and the bin.  The same 
        RMA number appears at the top of the associated paperwork.</p>

    <steps>
      <stepsection>To log in a meter:</stepsection>
      <step>
        <cmd>Get the bin containing the M800 and the customer paperwork 
          from the assignment shelf in Technical Services and carry it to the 
          calibration station.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Review the paperwork received with the M800 unit for recalibration.  Make 
          sure that the RMA number on the sheet matches the tags on the equipment.  Also 
          check that the part number and the serial number on the sheets match the 
          transmitter received.</cmd>
